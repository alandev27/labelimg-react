# LabelImg-React

A custom labelImg inspired labelling tool for AI computer vision image detection. Allows you to set bounding boxes with polygon or rectangles. Edit modes:

**0** - nothing  
**1** - rectangle  
**2** - polygon

Saves to YOLO format currently.

Refactoring and documentation would be very welcome :)

You need Node.js and NPM to run this

I will add better documentation, cleaner and more features soon. Features I'm thinking of include:

-   drag to move bounding boxes
-   lines and points
-   better editing capabilities for polygons (and other stuff)
-   rendering everything as SVG graphics rather than some as HTML and other as SVG

**BTW VERY IMPORTANT**

I haven't added labels so this is not in a usable state yet but that will come soon

### Setup

You can run `npm run dev` to try it out currently. In the future better CLI commands and maybe an app with tauri and electron will be implemented.
